		<p>CAO is where I usually play. My best games get to around xp level 14. Mainly play as TrFi, DSVM, or TrMo on Sprint. I'll spectate a game if they play as one of my main characters or if they have a lot of spectators.</p>

		<p>I get much better ping on CSZO, but it has messed up my saved games multiple times, and I had to switch back to CAO.</p>
