		<h1>Hello World</h1>
		<p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>
		<a href="http://crawl.akrasiac.org/rawdata/Djent/">My morgue files on CAO.</a>
		<p>CAO is where I usually play. My best games get to around xp level 14. Mainly play as GrFi and assassins, or TrMo when playing Sprint. I'll spectate a game if they seem interesting.</p>
		<a href="http://dobrazupa.org/morgue/djent/">My morgue files on CSZO.</a>
		<p>I get much better ping on CSZO, but it has messed up my saved games multiple times, and I had to switch back to CAO.</p>
		<p>I'd rather not have any personally identifying information on here until I decide whether to make this my online portfolio.</p>
