<h1>Hot Swapping UserStyle Colors Using CSS Variables</h1>
<p>June 11 2016</p>
<p>
I've recently been interested in learning to write browser extensions, 
inspired by <a href="https://karpathy.github.io/2013/11/23/chrome-extension-programming/">this post</a>.
To get started, I've been making my own custom CSS using 
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/">Stylish</a>.
</p>
<p>
Changing a site's look is good, but making it become part of an overall theme is better. I've been writing
some small utilities to automate the swapping of config files in my Arch Linux installation, switching out
the .Xresources file, modifying my .xinitrc, changing which background gets applied, etc. - the ability to
swap out the colors in my custom CSS would also be great to this end!
</p>
<p>
My solution to this is to use CSS variables in a directory of theme-specific .css files, and then do a simple
<font face="courier">cp theme.css current.css</font>. Each User Style in use by Stylish will have
<font face="courier">@import url('file:///home/username/Themes/current.css')</font> to grab the variables
defined by each seperate theme. Then, instead of declaring colors over and over using hex values, the User
Style will be able to reference the intended variable from the current theme.
</p>
<p>
One potential problem with this, is that CSS variables aren't supported by Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge,
though I haven't checked to see whether Stylish even exists as an extension for those browsers.
