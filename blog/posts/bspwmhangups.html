<h1>Hangups With bspwm Config</h1>

To go along with my desktop theming, I wanted to mess with borders in bspwm. 
This lead me through the process of actually updating my <font face="courier">.config/bspwm/bspwmrc file</font> to 0.9.1. 
I had previously been making config modifications through a <font face="courier">startup.sh</font> file I would run on startup,
but that is not very clean.
To begin, I removed everything that was left from the default <font face="courier">bspwmrc</font> that I started with - particularly
the <font face="courier">bspc monitor -d I II III IV...</font> which I had abandoned for just three virtual desktops - Desktop1, Desktop2, and Desktop3.
In bspwm 0.9.1, this needs to go after all <font face="courier">bspc config</font> commands.
I replaced this with three calls for <font face="courier">bspc monitor -d DesktopX</font> after adding the desktops with <font face="courier">bspc monitor -a DesktopX</font>.
</p>
<p>
Before I added the <font face="courier">bspc monitor -d</font> commands, I was wondering why my window border changes were not taking affect.
That was why - <font face="courier">bspc monitor -d</font> refreshes the settings of the monitor.
</p>
<p>
One last thing that tripped me up, and is the most embarrasing is the border colors.
I was trying to set them with <font face="courier">bspc config focused_border_color #FFFFFF</font> but only after an hour of searching did I realize that I needed to escape the #!
</p>
<p>
Anyways, my updated bspwmrc file will be in my arch-config-2015 repository - in the 2016 branch of course!
Not sure what I'll do with all my themeed config files. 
It doesn't make much sense to put them all in my config repository - they might need their own themes-dotfiles repository or something.
