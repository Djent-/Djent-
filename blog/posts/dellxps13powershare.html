<h1>How to enable Dell Powershare USB Charging on Early 2015 Dell XPS 13</h1>
<ul>
<li>1. Power off your computer</li>
<li>2. Power on your computer</li>
<li>3. Mash/hold F12 while the computer boots</li>
<li>4. Enter BIOS Settings</li>
<li>5. Expand USB Settings</li>
<li>6. Click on Powershare Settings and check the Powershare box</li>
</ul>
<p>While I was in my BIOS settings, I deactivated BlueTooth and the webcam, as I do not use them anyway.</p>
<p>I enabled this in order to use my laptop as an external battery charger while playing Pokemon Go. Seems it will work well.</p>
